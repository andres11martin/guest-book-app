# Guest Book App

This app was my first experience working with databases. The front-end was developed with React.js and its framework Next.js. And the back-end with Node.js and its framework Express. The database used was MondoDB and its framework mongoose.

Its a very simple app where you can leave messages and read all past messages that people left me.
